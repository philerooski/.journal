- On July 18, 2016, Charles Kinsey, a black behavior therapist, was shot by the police while lying on his back with his hands in the air. According to a police representative, the officer was aiming at the autistic man sitting next to Kinsey. The autistic man was armed with a toy truck. The Washington post article also reports that "[d]uring a news conference later Thursday, John Rivera, president of the Miami-Dade County Police Benevolent Association, called the shooting an accident. 'Sometimes police officers make mistakes,' Rivera said. 'They are not computers. They are not robots. They are God's creation.'"
